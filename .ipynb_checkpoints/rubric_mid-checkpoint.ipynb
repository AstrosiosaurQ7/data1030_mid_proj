    "### Midterm project presentation\n",
    "The purpose of the semester-long project is to give you hands-on experience working with the machine learning pipeline. For the midterm presentation, you should be done with EDA, splitting, and preprocessing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project presentations are on October 17-18-19 in-person, the exact time slots are tbd but we will send out a google sheet to sign up a week before the presentations. We will have six 2-hour sessions set aside. You will have 6 minutes to present, 2-3 minutes for questions, and 1 min to change speakers. Please make sure to be present for your whole session on the day you present so you can listen to your fellow students’ presentations and we encourage you to ask questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please show the draft of your slides to your TA mentor a couple of days before the presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation is basically a quick walk-through of your report.\n",
    "Requirements\n",
    "Title slide (1 point)\n",
    "Your title slide should include the title of your presentation, your name, institute, the date of your presentation, and a link to your GitHub repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intro slide (2 points)\n",
    "Basically summarize the report’s intro section. The intro slide should explain the problem you want to solve, why this is important, is it regression or classification, and where you got the data from. \n",
    "\n",
    "EDA slide(s) (7 points)\n",
    "Show us what you think was the most interesting, unexpected, or important insight that you gained during EDA. Present at least three different informative visualization types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting and preprocessing slide(s) (5 points)\n",
    "Describe briefly how you split the data and why. What preprocessors did you use and why? How many features and data points you have after preprocessing, did you have missing values and if you did how did you deal with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep your time (you have a 30 sec grace period but we will deduct 3 points for every minute you go overtime; we round up to the minute)\n",
    "Please practice your presentation out loud at least once and make sure you can fit everything into 6 minutes. Moderators in conferences usually do not let you go over time. They will make noise, come to the stage and stand next to you looking at you, or try to signal in other ways that it’s time to wrap up. It is rude to go overtime and delay the presentations of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your slides are not too busy! Your slides should not contain full sentences or paragraphs, only your key points as phrases. Large images and short text is the way to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the figures are readable from a distance! If the text on your figures is too small, your audience won’t be able to see what’s on your figure. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is no need to add everything to your slides. We will record your presentation and grade what you say as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to speak out loud and with a good pace (don’t rush), and keep eye contact with your audience. A good presentation is about story-telling and engaging your audience. If you feel compelled to speak fast and rush so you can go through all of your slides in time, don’t. Less is more. Cut out a slide or two to save time. If you feel compelled to read from your slides or from your notes, don’t. Most audiences are annoyed by this."

    "### Rubric: Midterm Project Report\n",
    "The purpose of the semester-long project is to give you hands-on experience working with the machine learning pipeline. For the first stage of the project, we would like you to identify your guiding question, find the dataset you plan to use to answer the question, perform exploratory data analysis, split the dataset, and perform preprocessing using pandas, matpotlib, and sklearn. Your proposal should be maximum 2 pages, excluding any figures, tables, and references. The report should be similar in style and structure to a research paper. \n",
    "Deadline\n",
    "Please submit your midterm project report on gradescope by October 21th 5pm (as usual, there is a two-hour grace period until 7pm). We highly encourage you to send your draft report to your assigned TA mentor for review before the submission deadline, so that they can provide you feedback before you turn in the final version on gradescope. The report will be graded by your TA mentor. If you have any questions, please post a question on Ed Discussion or come to the office hours. Please note that if you ask your TA mentor for feedback at the last minute, they might not be able to get back to you because each TA mentors ~13 students. Plan ahead and don’t leave the work to the last minute!\n",
    "Requirements\n",
    "We describe what sections you should include in your report and what you should describe in those sections. Your goal is to write as if you were writing a scientific publication. Please use the section titles below. This will help the grading process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduction (10 points)\n",
    "Clearly describe the problem you want to solve. \n",
    "What is the target variable?\n",
    "Is the problem regression or classification?\n",
    "Why is this interesting/important?\n",
    "Number of data points and number of features.\n",
    "Add a 1-2 paragraph description or overview of the features.\n",
    "Where did the data come from? How was it collected? \n",
    "If dataset is not well-documented, write a detailed description for each feature (if feature is categorical, describe each category; if feature is numerical, include the unit of the quantity and what it measures)\n",
    "If the dataset is from Kaggle/UCI/already described, do some literature search. Write a short description about 2-3 public projects or publications where the data has been used, what did the authors find, what ML question did they solve and how successful they were (evaluation metric and test scores). The results of the previous work gives you expectation for your ML results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (10 points)\n",
    "Perform a thorough EDA on each column in your dataset and pay special attention to your target variable\n",
    "Use .describe or .value_counts, create histograms or bar plots as appropriate\n",
    "Visualize the target variable. If it’s a classification problem, calculate the balances of each class. If it’s a regression variable, study its distribution. Any skewness? Outliers? Do the values vary over several orders of magnitudes or just one?\n",
    "Create other type of figures using two columns\n",
    "There is no need to include everything in the report.\n",
    "Choose at least three but maximum five figures that you think are interesting or important and one of those figures should show the target variable. Do not include three figures of the same type (e.g., you’ll lose points if you submit three bar plots). Use at least two figure types.\n",
    "Write a figure caption for each figure.\n",
    "Make sure your figures are publication-quality. Please print out your report before you submit it and make sure the figures are readable, the font size is similar to the text font size, axes are labeled, the figures have sufficient resolution (usually 300 dpi).\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing (10 points)\n",
    "Discuss how you split the dataset and why.\n",
    "Is your dataset IID?\n",
    "Does it have group structure?\n",
    "Is it time-series data?\n",
    "How should you split the dataset given your ML question to best mimic future use when you deploy the model?\n",
    "Apply MinMaxEncoder or StandardScaler on the continuous features\n",
    "Apply OneHotEncoder or OrdinalEncoder on categorical features\n",
    "Describe why you chose a particular preprocessor for each feature.\n",
    "How many features do you have in the preprocessed data?\n",
    "\n",
    "References (2 points)\n",
    "Cite previous work and add your citations to the ‘References’ section which should be the last section of your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Github repository (3 points)\n",
    "Please create a public github repository for your project and include the link in your report.\n",
    "For now, there should be three folders in your repository:\n",
    "data: download your dataset into this folder.\n",
    "figures: any figures you make should be saved in this folder in png, jpg, or pdf format. You can and should have more figures in here than what you have in your report.\n",
    "src: your python notebooks should be in this folder. Make sure that your code reads in the data from the data folder and saves the figures directly into the figures folder.\n"
